                <p class="lead drop-cap">"And with 2nd pick of the 2003 Draft, the Detroit Pistons select Darko Miličić from Serbia and Montenegro."</p>
                
                <p>No one could’ve predicted the trajectory of Darko’s career as David Stern announced the pick on June 26th. With the words of the then-commissioner, Darko Miličić became one of the most memorable NBA busts in recent history of the NBA.
                </p>
                <p>As we diagnose the Serbian’s highly controversial career, some questions may come to mind:                    
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who is really at fault for the disappointing career of Darko? </li>
                    <li>Was he purely a scouting error?</li> 
                    <li>Can we place the blame on the Pistons for selecting Darko?</li> 
                    <li>Or was Darko his own worst enemy?</li>
                <p></p>
               <p>I have been closely following Darko’s career ever since his brief stint with the Knicks. I've always had a soft spot for high draftees that don't pan out. There’s always something in me that has faith that they will breakout into the stars they were destined to be. (I know a thing or two about not meeting expectations.)
               </p>                            
               <p>Chauncey Billups played for 4 different teams in his first 4 years in the NBA averaging 11 PPG. He later went on to be the Final's MVP that same season. But the more I dug into this I came to an understanding that he was just an anomaly and disappointing top 5 picks were just an everyday thing in the NBA.
               </p>
               <p>Nonetheless, I was ecstatic to have Darko on the squad. I have always embraced the fantasy of struggling players re-blossoming in the garden. Maybe this is what made Jeremy Lin's emergence so impactful for me. But just like how it was with Rose, Noah, Jimmer Fredette, or T-Mac, the New York Knicks always seems to be the place where old “stars” go to die. Despite this repetitive abuse from the Knicks, I stayed hopeful for Darko. 
               </p>
               <P><i>Boy, I was wrong.</i>
               </P>
                <p>But I did want to get one thing clear: <b>Darko was not some garbage player.</b></p>
               <P>It is immensely unfair to compare him to the likes of Anthony Bennett or Hasheem Thabeet.
                Heck, I’m even convinced that the scouts did their jobs for this pick.</P>
               <p>Darko was a stud. Just see his pre-draft videos. He had almost everything you could ask for in a young center (in the early 2000s, of course). He had the agility, the athleticism, the shot blocking, the post moves, so everything indicated that this player was going to excel at the next level.</p>

               <P>So what went wrong? What really happened to the supposedly future All-star? </P>
               <p>I’ve divided his career to 3 timelines:</p>
               <P>1. Young Darko of the Pistons</P>
               <P>Unlike the rest of his draft peers, Milicic was drafted into the eventual championship team. While most of the 2003 lottery draftees were integrated into the starting line up in their rookie season, Milicic barely saw any action behind Ben Wallace. Having Larry Brown as a coach didn’t help (He hates rookies!). We saw his confidence being shot and clearly saw a stunt in development during his time there (Thanks a lot Larry Brown!). There were days where he looked like the 2nd overall pick, but on most days, he looked disinterested.</P>
               <P>2. Journeyman Darko (ORL - MEM - NYK)</P>
               <P>Milicic was traded to Orlando and served as a backup for Dwight Howard. He then signed a contract with Memphis, only to backup Marc Gasol. He was then traded to the New York Knicks to only be traded once again, to the Minnesota Timberwolves. On every team, you saw glimpses of why he was a high pick but there was never any consistency to his game. He often looked indifferent while being on the court. His interest of playing basketball was at an all-time low.</P>
               <P>3. Final Chance (MIN)</P>
               <P>On the Timberwolves, I thought I was finally starting to see the Darko I’ve been waiting for. He almost led the league in blocks during the 2010-2011 season. He wasn’t what people were expecting him to be on draft night but it seemed like he had finally found his groove to be an effective NBA player. Of course something went wrong. Nikola Pekovic, a second rounder, started playing very well and eventually took the starting position along with most of Darko’s minutes. Darko was better than Pekovic defensively since he always had a strong body that he used well. Nonetheless, Darko slowly found himself out of the rotation. Minnesota was the last time he played any sort of meaningful minutes as he retired from the NBA in 2013 at the young age of 27.</P>
               <p>Now, let's see why he is often regarded as one of the top busts in the NBA.</p>
               <P></P>
               <h2><b><u>The Dominance of the 2003 Draft</u></b></h2>
               <p>
                <img src="images/wheel-1000.jpg" srcset="images/NBA_Draft.jpg 2000w, images/wheel-1000.jpg 1000w, images/wheel-500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                </p>

               <P>Here’s a list of some players who were selected after Darko:</P>
               <ul>
                <li>Carmelo Anthony</li>
                <li>Dwyane Wade</li> 
                <li>Chris Bosh</li> 
                <li>Chris Kaman</li>
                <li>Kirk Hinrich</li>
                <li>T.J. Ford</li>
                <li>Luke Ridnour</li>
                <li>David West</li>
                <li>Boris Diaw</li>
                <li>Kendrick Perkins</li>
                <li>Leandro Barbosa</li>
                <li>Josh Howard</li>
                <li>Mo Williams</li>
                <li>Kyle Korver</li>
                <p></p>
                <p>The ‘03 Draft is of course the most talent-filled draft since the ‘96 Draft. All the players above had better careers than Darko. Heck, even Luke Walton had better seasons than Darko.
                </p>
                <p>But surprisingly, a lot of other high lottery picks still do not get the same amount of scrutiny that Darko has gotten. Kwame Brown was drafted 1st in 2001 but the rest of the draft did not include noteworthy players on the level of Melo or Wade. Pau nor Randolph ever reached the stardom of Carmelo or Wade. I’m not saying Kwame also didn’t get his fair share of criticism but Darko had far more talent than Kwame Brown and it’s not even close. (And let's be real, Kwame going first was MJ's mistake, not Kwame's mistake)
                </p>
                <p>I truly believe that Darko is a case where opportunities were hardly there for him and when they were, he didn't take advantage of it. He was drafted into a championship team where his talents were not needed. It seemed like no one else wanted his talents either.
                </p>
                <p>I think scouts did their job on Milicic but what people don't understand is that scouts look if the players have the physical tools to succeed in the NBA. They don't control their demeanor, practices, or training. Nowadays, I believe NBA front offices are more concerned with the mental aspect of the player but a lot has changed in the league since 2003. From my research I concluded that people only saw flashes of what Darko could do because he was constantly on teams where he was a second tier center. He might’ve never been given a fair chance to develop.
                </p>
                <p>He was always a serviceable back-up but he was continually tagged with the bust tag because of the success of the players in his draft class. Lack of confidence was key for Milicic and that's something he never overcame simply because of the backlash from the media and the public. There is also the fact that he was lazy and fat. He could've had it if he wanted to. So while I wouldn't necessarily brand him as a bad pick, I still do understand the sentiment of Darko being a bust. Draft position does not mean good development. The Piston’s failed in terms of player development and Darko Milicic pretty much failed himself with everything else.
                </p>
                <p>Regardless of how his NBA career went, we wish the best for Darko Milicic as he continues to pursue his love for kickboxing and agriculture.
                </p>
